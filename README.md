# Myapp
Hi there,

My name is Giang Nguyen. I am a student of Computer Programming and Analysis.

This is a prototype of a centralized health care platform I built for Seneca - Digital Health Hackathon 2021.

It was built from scratch in my free time from Mar 3 to Mar 4, 2021. I used HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Angular to build the application since I was learning Angular at the time.

Here is my another project that simulates airBnB and was deployed to Heroku: https://evening-river-85102.herokuapp.com/

Thank you for visiting!

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
